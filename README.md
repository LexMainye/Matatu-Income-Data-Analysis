**Brief History of Matatus**

Matatus are the go to method of public transportation in Kenya, originating in the 1960s. The term "matatu" comes from the Swahili word for "three," referring to the three cents charged per trip when they first began operating. Initially, they were informal, privately owned minibuses or vans that filled a gap in public transportation. Over the years, matatus have become a cornerstone of Kenya's transport sector, evolving into a more structured yet still vibrant and culturally significant industry.

**Background on Analyzing Hypothetical Matatu Income Data**

In this project, I aim to analyze hypothetical income data for matatus, which has been generated synthetically to simulate real scenarios. Using hypothetical data allows us to focus on analytical methods, data modeling, and interpretation without the need for access to actual operational data, which may be sensitive or unavailable.

**What the Hypothetical Data Includes:**
The data contains simulated data for a week which includes:
* Daily Income : This is fare paid by passengers.
  
* Time Period :

The income data is categorized into specific time periods to better analyze trends throughout the day. Below is a breakdown of the time periods:

| **Time Period**     | **Description**                                      | **Approximate Time Range** |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Early Morning**    | The first part of the day, often busy with commuters starting their day. | 4:00 AM - 6:59 AM          |
| **Morning**          | The regular morning rush with peak passenger traffic. | 7:00 AM - 9:59 AM          |
| **Late Morning**     | A quieter period as the morning rush subsides.       | 10:00 AM - 11:59 AM        |
| **Early Afternoon**  | Transition period with moderate passenger flow.      | 12:00 PM - 1:59 PM         |
| **Afternoon**        | Midday activity with shoppers, and office workers. | 2:00 PM - 3:59 PM          |
| **Late Afternoon**   | Increasing activity as people begin their commute home. | 4:00 PM - 5:59 PM          |
| **Evening**          | High traffic as the majority return home from work.  | 6:00 PM - 8:59 PM          |
| **Night**            | Reduced activity with occasional late-night travelers. | 9:00 PM - 11:59 PM         |

This breakdown helps identify peak and off-peak periods, providing insights into revenue fluctuations and operational efficiency.


* Date: The simulated dates that the transactions happened.
* Payment Channels : This comprises of cash and mobile money channels (M-PESA, Airtel Money & T-Kash)
* Gender : This comprises of male and female channels.
